## AWS

Looked at some services offered by AWS and what they do:

- EC2 - you can spin up virtual machine instances. Since I had my account for more than 12 months, I will get charged. However this is very small as I only chose the nano/micro option.
- S3 - storage where you can have your assets in e.g. images
- D3 - domain name provider
