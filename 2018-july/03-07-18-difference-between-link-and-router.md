## Difference between Link and Router

Link tells the location for your app to go to and Router then shows content based on this location.

Why do we use Link instead of anchor tag? The default behaviour of anchor tag is to reload the page when the link is clicked on. However with the Link, the app doesn't reload and overrides the default behaviour of an anchor tag.
