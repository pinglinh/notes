## Signal Code Injection Tool

There is quite a nifty tool where you can inject a piece of code e.g. a banner to a website. This is good when the code is only short-lived i.e. there is a promotion on the site for 2-3 days. You can also schedule it so that it is active for a certain amount of time. This is quicker than having to go through PRs and have the code go through many build processes and deployments before it goes into production. You can also select on which web pages this particular code should be injected into and/or set conditions.

Also today was the first day I picked up a story from the team's kanban board! :tada:
