## The CICD pipeline

Today I learned more about the process of CI/CD pipeline.

You're working on a feature, once you finish you do a PR to develop branch. When that gets approved by 2 people, this creates a build package in TeamCity (CI). Once the build is finished, this gets picked up in Octopus (deployment tool) via the nuspec file which is included in the root file of the project. In Octopus you go to the dev channel and look at the dev package that was picked up from TeamCity - it should match the name for the package that was in TeamCity e.g. 1.2.0-dev.3 , then in Octopus it should also say this in the dev channel. Choose which env you want to deploy this to. For dev packages (which come from the develop branch) you can't deploy it further than test or int. We would deploy this to 221 dev for own dev testing. Once that is done, we promote/deploy it to test env to be QAed. Once QA says it's good to go, we go back to version control and create a release branch from develop - this will start building in TeamCity and create a release package. We then need to deploy this to Int (check its fine) then request change from change release manager to get this to pre-prod and then prod.
